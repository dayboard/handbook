# Vacations

This is our current guideline for vacation and taking time off. It applies to everyone (including founders) that's been working here for over a year:

* 15 days of paid vacation
* Up to 10 "personal days" (e.g. sick, travel, "low-energy", last-minute stuff, etc.)
* Stat holidays
* 5 days of unused vacation days can be carried over at year's end

Newly hired team members will be prorated vacation and personal days, depending on their start date.

### Instructions

1. Send a heads up to john@dayboard.co. Most requests are likely okay. Rule of thumb: just make sure someone's covering your work / support tickets so we don't have to chase you down while you're camping in the wilderness. :D
2. Update the [vacation tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JMjr0J68G5B3evwOuWfNCygXDPbCn1QzmlhtcdoVWdE/edit#gid=0
)
3. Post an update on #vacations on Slack!
4. Enjoy your time off + take lots of pictures if you're going somewhere exotic :)
